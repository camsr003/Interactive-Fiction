The Asylum Corridor is a room. "You step into a narrow, dimly lit hallway, the air thick with the scent of mildew and decay. The cold, damp stone walls seem to close in around you, their surfaces slick with moisture. Flickering torches cast long, dancing shadows that seem to twist and writhe like malevolent spirits."

The Corridor Door is a door. It is north of the Asylum Grounds and south of the Asylum Corridor. The description of the Corridor Door is "The heavy wooden door looms before you, its surface marred by deep claw marks and the stains of time. Rusted iron bands reinforce its frame, and the faint scent of mildew wafts from the cracks. Each creak of its hinges echoes through the air, as though the door itself protests against being opened. It feels as though it has been both a barrier of protection and a harbinger of doom.". The Corridor Door is open, lockable, and locked.
